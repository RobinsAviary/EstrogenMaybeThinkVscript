This is a vscript file used on [cp_estradiol]() for the final point. It is used to set a func_movelinear's position target to the capture percentage of the third point.

This may also work as an example for how to decode TF2's capture percentages.

Admittedly, this a lot of this is still messy and probably not best practice. But there is not enough documentation out there, thus why I'm uploading this.
